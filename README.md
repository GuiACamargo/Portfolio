# Gui Camargo Portfolio 😀
You can access my portfolio [here](https://guicamargo.vercel.app/) :). But if you want to run it locally, you can download it the way you prefer
and on the root folder you run these commands in order on the terminal:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
After that it should be available on https://localhost:5173
